# Core algorithms
> Fast and simple trie and hash table algorithms

The repository is consistf of two core algorithms: hash table and wildchar supported trie. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table

## Getting started

```shell
make 
```

## Features

* Hash table insert and lookup
* Wildchar support in trie
* Trie insert and lookup
* Trie lookup all to lookup for multiple values
* Better memory usage using SUPER nodes in trie
